# AI Model with Guardrails for Fairness and Explainability

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a machine learning model for predicting loan approvals, with guardrails added for **fairness** and **explainability**. The model is built using Python, trained on the [UCI Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult), and implements fairness mitigation using the **Fairlearn** library and model explainability using **SHAP**.
