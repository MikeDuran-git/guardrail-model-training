# guardrail-model-training
This project demonstrates the creation of a machine learning model for predicting loan approvals, with guardrails added for fairness and explainability. The model is built using Python, trained on the UCI Adult Income Dataset, and implements fairness mitigation using the Fairlearn library and model explainability using SHAP.
